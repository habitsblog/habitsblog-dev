### How to Find and Fix the Causes of Bad Habits

In order to delve further into this topic, we first need to revisit cravings--what exactly is a craving, actually?

*"A craving is a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive."*

An example, as given by Clear: "I want to eat tacos." is the manifestation of the deeper motive "I need food to survive.".

Other examples of underlying motives include:
- Conserve energy
- Obtain food and water
- Find love and reproduce
- Connect and bond with others
- Win social acceptance and approval
- Reduce uncertainty
- Achieve status and prestige

Almost any product or service centered around the forming of habits (explicitly or implicitly) does not necessarily generate new motivation, but attaches itself to existing *underlying motives*. Your craving for cigarettes might be a manifestation of your desire for relief and calm. Playing video games? Achieving status and prestige. As Clear so eloquently puts it:

*"Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires"
