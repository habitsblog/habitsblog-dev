This chapter is about rounding out the teachings of the 3rd law: "Make it easy!", and by extension its inversion for bad habits "Make it hard!", and starts with an amusing anecdote that has forever soiled the way I look at *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*.

As the apocryphal tale goes, Victor Hugo had spent the majority of 1830 on various non-literary pursuits. Entertaining the Parisian elite with dinner parties, hobnobbing, and casting the occasional glance towards his four young children, the newest of which had been born in the summer of that very year.

His publisher was not exactly delighted with his lack of output, this distaste understandably stemming largely from their agreement that Hugo would deliver a book by the end of the year. Dissatisfied, the publisher ventured to tighten the thumb-screws, and set Hugo a hard deadline for the the end of February 1831--meaning that he had less than 6 months to deliver a product that didn't yet exist in any, shape, or form.



Victor (unknowingly) applied Clear's third law of habit forming--specifically, the inversion of this law, "Make it hard". He needed a way to ensure that he wouldn't waste his time socialising, and went to the extreme to force himself away from his proclivities.

In a move that was surely very popular with his wife and children, as well as his staff and assistants, Hugo locked away all of his clothes, save for a large shawl. His thinking rested on the fact that he couldn't possibly leave the house or invite guests, if he didn't have anything to wear! That's all it took--his next novel, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* was published two weeks early.




### Commitment Devices and Habit Automation

Victor Hugo used a *commitment device* in order to lock out his bad habits, but the same can be done to bind oneself to good habits. By making a decision, you can effectively pre-emptively make it harder to avoid the habit or behaviour you wish to achieve. The crux lies in changing the situation such that it becomes more difficult *not* to engage in the habit of choice.

The best way to break a bad habit, is to make it impractical or impossible to do. In many cases, enacting a single commitment device can reap returns over and over again!
