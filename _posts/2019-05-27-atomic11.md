*"It's easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change"*

**Personal Context**

Once again, I find myself encountering characteristic patterns and behaviours, that I hadn't *really* found a way of explicitly describing. The notion of motion vs action concisely described a central struggle that I encounter around many different aspects in my life.

I've always been one to find solace and comfort in planning and organisation, even though I'm not a naturally organised person. The notion of performing a peripheral activity that is somewhat related to the main goal, without actually performing any 'reps', is something that I relate to, slightly too well.
For me, a key tool to get past this has been to decrease the barriers to engaging in the behaviour. Clear will soon further describe in relation to his fourth law ("*make it easy*").

For me, it comes down to lowering expectations for the first reps--it doesn't need to be (and is unlikely to be!) a masterpiece in its first iteration! Finding the self-acceptance that I would not excel or impress anybody with my first fresco was an important step in lowering the barrier towards actually engaging in the chosen behaviour.


### Imaginary Progress

This chapter starts out with a simple, but incredibly important, concept.

*It's easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change"*

*The best is the enemy of the good.*

There is a clear distinction between being in motion, and taking action. Being in motion--planning, strategising, preparing--are all important parts of the process, whatever you are setting out to accomplish, but they don't *produce a result*.

For this, you need action. Motion is useful and often important, but will never generate a result on its own, and comes with a nasty component that I know all too well. Motion seems like a form of progress, a sort of peripheral movement, makes you feel as if you're accomplishing something towards your chosen habit or goal. Motion makes you feel as if you're doing something useful, without the possibility of failure.

Rather than planning, you want to be practicing. Repetition breeds quality and skill, not planning and preparation. You just need to get your reps in! Watching videos on form, stretching, and shopping for compression shorts, is not going to increase your squat PB or reduce your best 5k time!

### How long does it actually take?

Fun fact: Behaviour automation through repetition works by literally changing the structure of your brain. Repeating an activity strengthens neural connections, which neuropsychologist Donald Hebb quaintly summarises as:

*"Neurons that fire together, wire together."*

Your brain is very malleable, and responds directly to the needs of the types of activities you perform. Accordingly, regions that are used intensely (and *repetitively*) may grow or shrink in size, depending on usage. Taxi drivers tend to have larger hippocampi, while musicians on average have noticeably larger cerebella. Interestingly, these regions return to their original sizes once no longer accessed as intensively--when a taxi driver retires, their hippocampus tends to shrink back down to average size.

In order for a behaviour to become a habit, you need to put in the reps. Activating those specific neural pathways, and strengthening them, leads to *automaticity*: the ability to perform a behaviour without thinking about each distinct step. In order for a behaviour to be considered a "habit", you need to have reached a certain level of automaticity in that behaviour. The higher the automaticity, the less effort and concentration required to perform the desired behaviour.

### How long will it take?

This depends on a great number of factors, which varies from person to person. What can be said, is that the learning curve is very likely to take a similar shape to the one above, where the amount of effort required diminishes over time, and eventually plateaus.

The most important element, is to repeat the habit--as a rule, the more a habit is repeated, the sooner it's automaticity will rise (to a degree, of course).
