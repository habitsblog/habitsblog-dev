### Conversational Intelligence

Conversation is how we naturally connect with other humans in the world around us. Applied neutrally, it can be a source of information. With malice, it can be used to persuade or subjugate--and with goodwill, it can be used to console, romance, or teach.

In her work on *"Conversational Intelligence"*, Judith Glaser emphasises the importance of conversations as the key mechanism to connect and grow with others, to thrive in both personal and professional settings. She describes conversations to be like the "umbilical cords that provide nourishment", which can lay the foundations in a workplace culture that enables the greatness of its followers. It does however, all come down to the quality of these conversations.

We humans are very reactive to stimulus, just so with conversation. We feel some form of either good or bad, depending on the conversation. As soon as contact is made, a series of autonomous biochemical and neurological responses take place that determine how we react to being in contact with another person. Our biological instincts for harm-prevention activate if we feel threatened, engaging a feeling of distrust. A different section of the brain manages the building of trust, that which has enabled the collaboration that has elevated human society to the present.

Given any perception of threat however, the fear response takes over--distrust always prevails given that self-preservation is the prime directive.

The chemical component associated with each conversation has an empirically demonstrated impact on performance, innovation, and productivity. Unhealthy conversations based on distrust, deceit, and avoidance, demote performance in these metrics, whereas healthy conversations, based on trust and high levels of interaction dynamics, promote them.

### Conversational Dashboard

Glaser placed great emphasis on the power of these types of healthy conversations, and how they impact organisational cohesion and success. In the *Conversational Dashboard* she gives some examples as to how the level of trust impacts which part of the brain is active, and how open one can be to collaborate and innovate with their chosen conversation partner.

She defines three overarching levels of conversation:

1. Transactional - Defined by low trust, these types of conversations can be filed under "tell and ask". People are either trying to confirm that what they know is valid, or espouse their perspective without being open to that of another.

2. Positional - Defined by *conditional* trust, in the sense that conversation partners are probing to see how their arguments are perceived. Since trust is conditional, participants are defensive--if their fears can be subdued, they may progress to the next level--if not, they regress to level 1.

3. Transformational - Defined by high trust, only in these type of conversations do participants truly open themselves up for the opinions and ideas of others. We are more likely to listen, connect, and truly process what is being presented by our conversation partners in such a way that we may fruitfully collaborate and learn from oneanother.

Gives a bit more context to these levels, expanding them to 5 different tiers, with the same underlying principles.

It becomes readily clear how fickle and fragile our minds really are--a small notion of non-acceptance plays the role of the wild predator in potentially shutting down our capability to blossom creatively, by initiating a protective emotional response.

In part 2, we will look at more specific examples of how these "levels" of conversation play a part in workplace scenarios, as well as how they influence the functioning of an organisation as a whole.
