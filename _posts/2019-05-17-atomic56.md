*"The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply embedded in our culture."*

**Personal Context**

The quote above really hit me, in the sense that I've always been critical of my own sense of self-discipline. 'How do I attain this unbreakable willpower and monk-level discipline to stay focused and achieve my goals?' was a common self criticism that rang around in my head. The more I get a chance to break down how habits are structured and the triggers/cues that engage them work, I realise that everyone probably struggles with these kinds of thoughts to a certain degree. Finding a strategy that works for you is something probably almost everyone needs to do at some point in order to be more successful. My personal journey has been fraught with self deprecation towards this particular subject and I find it enlightening and relieving to encounter the topic discussed in this way. I have already started to bundle certain habits (coffee-morning wins), but am going to try and think of a way to help myself get focused when I start work. Integrating this phase of the day into a habit would greatly increase my productivity.



### The Secret to Self Control

As evidenced and reinforced by research done on military heroin addicts, environment is a huge factor in determining the strength of a habit, even if it's chemical. While culture often dictates a lack of discipline to come from an absence of willpower, evidence suggests that the people with the best self-control are in fact those who have to use it the least. Being smart with the way you position yourself within a context can have drastic impacts on how well you are able to make or break habits.

Scientists refer to the self-feeding nature of bad habits with the term **cue-induced wanting**. This essentially entails that an external trigger(**cue**) causes a subconscious compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit.

Even though it's possible to break bad habits, these cues are soo deeply ingrained that they are nigh impossible to remove. Finding yourself in the same environment years later, you might suddenly feel that pang to engage. Since maintaining iron willpower is nearly impossible in the long term, it is a far better strategy to manipulate your environment (as discussed in the [previous](https://habitsblog.github.io/2019/05/16/atomic45/) section). *Minimise access to the cue!*

Remember, referring to the first law of habit forming:

|Good Habit|Bad Habit|
|Make the cue obvious|Make the cue invisible|


### How to Make a Habit Irresistible

**The Second law**: Make it attractive!

Similarly to how animals are 'preloaded' with certain behaviours (as demonstrated by Tinbergen's bird-with-red-dotted-beak research), humans also react to certain stimulus subconsciously. These cues are known as *supernormal stimuli*. Hunting for thousands of years has conditioned people to react a certain way to food high in salt, fat, and sugar--this means that even now, we go into something of a frenzy at the sight of a Big Mac. The modern food industry is just one of many that market products to appeal to this natural sense of craving, and further enhance it by making products more attractive in all sorts of ways(texture, colour, odour, etc)--they enhance the cue by *making it attractive*, encouraging patrons to repeat the habit.

### What is craving?

In order to understand how to make a habit more attractive, or even triggered by a supernormal stimulus, we must understand craving, and the role of dopamine.

Dopamine is intrinsically interlinked with habits. Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop--the dopamine is what keeps you coming back. Rats who had their dopamine receptors blocked in experiments soon lost all interest in food, sex, and basically their will to live on the whole. While we often think of the dopamine release to be associated with engaging in the activity itself, it is important to note that dopamine is released also in **anticipation** of the activity. *The reward system in your brain that is activated when you receieve the reward, is the same system that is activated when you anticipate the reward!*

Above you see how dopamine spikes manifest depending on the stage of habit formation.

|A|Dopamine is released when the reward is experienced for the first time|
|B|The next time, dopamine is released in *anticipation*. Since the reward is expected, dopamine spike is minimal|
|C|If you don't receive the reward, you have a negative dopamine spike, because your expectations were subverted.|
|D|Reward is provided, but later than expected.|

These diagrams have a very important takeaway: **desire is the engine that drives behaviour**. After the reward is known and expected, the dopamine largely comes in anticipation of the reward.


### Temptation bundling

This method of making habits more attractive relies on bundling an action that you want to do, with an action that you need to do. Without going into great detail, the idea behind this is that you're more likely to find an initially unattractive behaviour attractive if you pair it with one of your favourite things to do. An classic example of this is watching a movie/series while running on the treadmill.

This strategy can be further combined with [habit stacking](https://habitsblog.github.io/2019/05/16/atomic45/), such that you can chain habits while tentation bundling for maximum effect, in the form:

1. After [current habit], I will [habit I need]
2. After [habit I need], I will [habit I want]

Temptation bundling is an excellent strategy to decrease the resistance towards a habit, by basically "softening the blow"!





Additional note: The author made reference to Dutch Nobel prize-winning scientist Nikolaas Tinbergen, and I caught the last name as familiar; the only Dutch economist to ever win the Nobel prize was also named Tinbergen. As it turns out, they were brothers! Apparently, they also had a third brother, who didn't win any Nobels--I wonder what the dinner table was like there at christmas.
