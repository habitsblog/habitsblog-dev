**Personal Context**


### The Role of Family and Friends

This section focuses on how culture and surrounding persons influence habit building, and the way we perceive certain activities and behaviours.

Humans have always been herd animals--in nomadic times, humans that stuck together had a higher chance of survival (for the most part.) Similar to our craving for fatty, salty, and sugary foods, we also have an innate desire to belong to part of a group.

 *Social norms*, or the set of cultural standards by which a society operates, are like invisible guidelines that shape the way people behave, and thus the formation of their habits. Clear describes the three societal sub-groups whose habits we are most likely to imitate:

 1. The close
 2. The many
 3. The powerful

 We explore the ways in which each of these groups offers opportunities to make habits more attractive, in line with the 2nd law of behaviour change.

#### The close

Just as we discussed earlier how a person's direct environment shapes their habit, so do the persons that inhabit that direct environment.

A study on partner fitness is referenced as an example; apparently a person is 57% more likely to become obese if their partner does so. The inverse is also true, although to a somewhat lesser degree (30%).

As a general rule, the closer you are to someone, the more likely you are to soak up their qualities or practices. Thus, it seems logical that:

**Strategy**: *"One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behaviour is the normal behaviour."*

Integrating yourself into a community where the norm is to part-take in a certain behaviour will make it all the more easier to engage in that behaviour yourself.

To make this even more powerful, you can join a culture where your desired behaviour is the norm, and you already have something in common with the group, e.g [nerd fitness](https://www.nerdfitness.com/).

#### The Many

Consider Solomon Asch's line experiment:

![line experiment](https://i.imgur.com/EJBkyTj.png)
{: align="middle"}
Line (C) is the same length as the line on the first card.
{: style="color: gray; font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"}

Participants are shown two cards, with a number of lines. There are many variations of this experiment, but in this one, participants were asked which of the three lines on the right card was most similar in length to the line on the left card (in this case C).

The experiment was performed in a room, with the lines up for display to a whole group of people who had been instructed to all answer with one of the obviously *incorrect* answers. What Asch found, was that as the group got large enough, the peer pressure led the test subject to forego the answer they knew to be right, and instead go along with the group. He also found that their likelihood to comply was significantly correlated with the size of the group.

It is easy to see how powerful this phenomena can be in shaping the behaviours of an individual--but there are some pitfalls to consider. Just as the participants in the test were pressured into giving the wrong answer in Asch's line test, the behaviour you exhibit might not be optimal, the most efficient, or good at all. It is important to contextualise! Joining the tribe, and engaging in behaviours that are the norm, feels great--you're conforming! Just remember that going against the grain might be even more difficult than doing it on your own..


#### The Powerful


Humans are drawn towards behaviours that garner admiration, respect, approval, and status. Since times of old the respect and approval of the group has often resulted in better chance of survival, more attractive mate, etc.

If you think about the self-help bookshelf at your local *parchmenterie*, you will likely find yourself surrounded by the works of powerful industrialists, world-leaders, elite athletes, and renowned academics. In trying to achieve success ourselves, we try to imitate behaviours of people that society considers successful.

We seek to attain the same rewards garnered by the habits of those people, and thus strive to imitate their behaviour.
