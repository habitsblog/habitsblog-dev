#### Decision Pathways

Academic research posits that approximately 40-50% of our daily behaviours are performed out of habit--the reality is probably even more stark, considering that these behaviours also act as decision nodes for other actions to follow. These *decisive moments* are like forks in the road, and set the stage for the action you will likely perform next.

Knowing this, the point from above more obvious--your behaviour isn't just shaped by your habits, but also where your habits lead you. They serve as the *entry point*, not the end point.

#### The Two Minute Rule

The two minute rule is a technique that takes the reduction of entry barriers to a new behaviour to a whole new level. It's all in the name really; it comes down to scaling habits down to make them as *easy* as possible. Not just easy, but absolutely *elementary*--such that you can perform them in two minutes or less. Some examples given by Clear emphasise how fundamentally this should be taken:

| Habit     | Two-Minute Version     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Read before bed       | Read one page       |
|Do 30 minutes of yoga|Take out my yoga mat|
|Run 5 Km|Put on my running shoes|

The secret is that it shouldn't feel like an overbearing challenge to do the two minute version. Being able to easily slip into that 'microhabit' will make it easier to fulfil the follwing activity--in the way tha habits lead us into certain behaviours. If you have your running shoes and shorts on, you're probably more likely to go out for a run. If you read a single page of your book, there's a good chance that you might read a few more!

A habit must be established before it can be improved, and one of the best ways to establish a habit is to make the barriers to entry as low as possible. A phrase that really stuck with me from this chapter was:

*"Master the habit of just showing up"*

#### Habit Phasing

The more you ritualise the beginning of a process, the easier it becomes to find the deeper focus necessary to refine that habit and push it to new limits. Of course, if you only read one page a day, it could take more than a year to finish your first one. The two minute rule is just the introductory step in a process by which you can develop a habit in phases.



In a very smooth and self-reinforcing way, you can build concrete habits in a stepwise fashion, rather than having to launch yourself into a Marathon training program straight away.

| Habit     | Phase 1 (Two minutes)    |Phase 2 |Phase 3 |Phase 4 |Phase 5 |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| Exercise Routine       |Change into workout clothes        |Step out the door, go for a walk|Drive to the gym, five minutes of exercise|Fifteen minutes at the gym, once a week| Three gym sessions per week|
|Becoming an early riser|Be home by 10PM|Have all devices off by 10PM|Be in bed by 10PM|Turn off the lights by 10PM|Wake up at 6AM|

In much the same way you would if you were working on a project or chasing another goal, breaking it up makes the entire process seem farm more surmountable, and allows to you retain a greater degree of oversight.


The two minute-rule isn't just for exercise though, you can also apply it to more abstract life goals. Almost any aspect of behavioural change can be initiated by just taking the two minute to tie your shoes.
