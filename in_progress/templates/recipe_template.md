This filling salad recipe does a great job of meeting nutritional requirements, and allows for infinite tweaking to suit your needs. Drop the chicken to make it vegeterian, and it still tastes great! Credits to Jannis for co-creating this delicious dish.

**Ingredients for 2-4**

- 300g lettuce of choice, leaves or shredded (multiple types is fun!)
- 300-400g chicken breast
- 200g Kidney beans (or other)
- 200g Lentils (soaked or pre-soaked)
- 200g Feta
- ~3 Medium sized sweet potatoes (enough to cover the bottom of a 40x20cm oven dish when sliced)
- 3-4 cloves of garlic
- 1 red onion
- 250g Cherry tomatoes
- 1/2 Cucumber
- 1 Bell pepper
- Olive oil
- Balsamic vinaigrette or lemon (for the dressing)
- Handful of rosemary
- Spices for the chicken (I use a lebanese spice blend of sumac, thyme, marjoran, oregano, and basil)


**Method**

1. Pre-heat the oven to 200Â°C.

2. Peel the potatoes and slice them into small disks about 5mm thick. Spread these evenly over an oven tray.
    - Peel the garlic and tear each clove roughly in half, dispersing the chunks on the potatoes.
    - Sprinkle on a good helping of olive oil, salt.
    - Cover generously with rosemary.
    - Place the tray in the oven for 35 minutes.

3. Find the biggest receptacle you have, in our case it was a giant soup pan, this will be where you assemble the salad. A pan is useful, because you can put the lid on and shake it vigorously over your head like a cave(wo)man, accelerating the mixing process. Anyway, cut the vegetables and dump them into your receptacle:
    - Cucumber into small chunks
    - Cherry tomatoes in half
    - Onions roughly chopped
    - Bell pepper into small chunks

4. Cut your chicken into, bite sized chunks, about the size of your thumb above the knuckle. Get an (olive) oiled frying pan nice and hot, and fry your chicken at high heat for 3-4 minutes, turning occasionally. Make sure to add your spices of choice, as well as salt and pepper. If your pan was hot enough, your chicken should end up browned on the outside, but still tender from within. If you're worried about the chicken being too raw/overcooked, cut open one of the thicker chunks about 2-3 minutes in, to see how they are doing.

5. Add the chicken to the salad-bowl-pan, as well as the potatoes, when they are ready.

6. Since there are already a lot of different flavours present in the dish, I usually stick with a very simple dressing of olive oil and either balsamic vinaigrette or lemon. Mix the two in a cup with some salt and pepper, to taste. Try to pour this into the salad evenly so that it spread around a bit.

7. Finally, use your hands to crumble the feta into the salad. Now that you have all the ingredients, only one step remains--time to shake!

8. You have two options:
    - If you don't have a lid, use salad tools (tongs, spoons, sporks, whatever) to mix the salad evenly.
    - If you have a lid, put it on. Grip your salad tightly and shake it around vigorously, in all directions (don't forget to go upside down a few times for good measure.)

9. That's it! Enjoy your salad!


Some potential tweaks:
- Replace feta with goat's cheese, or something else altogether?
- Try different types of beans, borlotti for instance!
- Replace chicken with tofu
- Substitute out vegetables, maybe try eggplant or radishes or something a little more exotic.
- Use a combination of different lettuces, we tried it with rocket and oak leaf lettuce.
